# Glossary

Comprehensive glossary of authentication, security, and Stytch-specific terms.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols and tools for building software applications.

**Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.

**Authorization**: The process of determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.

## B

**Biometrics**: Authentication method using unique biological characteristics like fingerprints or facial recognition.

## C

**Challenge**: An additional verification step required when a user's risk level is uncertain.

**Claims**: Statements about a user contained within a token (typically JWT).

## D

**Device Fingerprinting**: Technology that identifies devices based on their unique characteristics.

**DFP**: Device Fingerprinting Platform - Stytch's fraud detection system.

## E

**Enumeration**: An attack method attempting to discover valid user accounts.

## F

**Factor**: A category of authentication method (something you know, have, or are).

## J

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A compact, URL-safe token format for securely transmitting information.

## M

**Magic Link**: A passwordless authentication method using time-limited URLs sent via email.

**MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Security process requiring multiple authentication factors.

## O

**OAuth**: An authorization protocol allowing third-party applications to access user resources.

**OTP (One-Time Password)**: A password valid for only one login session or transaction.

## P

**Passkey**: A passwordless authentication standard using cryptographic key pairs.

**PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: Security extension for OAuth authorization code flow.

## R

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Access control method based on user roles within an organization.

## S

**SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)**: Standard for automating user provisioning.

**Session**: A semi-permanent interactive information exchange between user and application.

**SSO (Single Sign-On)**: Authentication process allowing users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials.

## T

**TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Algorithm generating time-limited passwords.

**Token**: A piece of data representing authentication or authorization credentials.

## W

**WebAuthn**: Web standard for passwordless authentication using public key cryptography.
